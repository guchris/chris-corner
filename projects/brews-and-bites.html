    <p class="intro">
        Building community is important to me. Maintaining and deepening friendships too. And lately, I've developed a passion for both coffee-making and pastry-baking. And all of this got me thinking â€“ why not bring all these good things together and throw a pop-up coffee shop right in my own apartment?<br><br>
        Imagine this: my space transforming into this chill, cozy spot where the smell of freshly brewed coffee meets the sweet aroma of baking pastries. You hear cups clinking, laughter bouncing off the walls. You see huge smiles, large embraces. You even snuggle up with Topher, the resident Shiba Inu.<br><br>
        Introducing Brews & Bites - a bi-weekly coffee pop-up, complete with delicious treats and the most wholesome vibes. Come stay awhile.
