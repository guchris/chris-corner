Coffee, banana bread, good vibes - what more could you want?!","story":"Finally, the moment arrived to put my apartment coffee pop-up plan into action! Inspired by creators on YouTube and TikTok, I decided it was high time to create my own cozy space for intimate conversations with friends. No need for them to fret over preparations, expenses, or nerves—this was a laid-back \'3rd place\' with no pressure, just pure enjoyment.<br/><br/>For this trial run, I kept the guest list small, inviting just a couple of close friends to join me. And of course, I couldn\'t resist designing a menu—it\'s been too long since I indulged in some creative design work, and it added a nice touch to the event while serving a practical purpose of showcasing the available treats and drinks.<br/><br/>Another goal of mine was to delve into baking more. There\'s something deeply satisfying about getting hands-on in the kitchen, and I\'m eager to explore a variety of recipes in the future. But for this inaugural gathering, I stuck with my trusted banana bread and coffee cake recipes, luckily having most of the ingredients on hand already.<br/><br/>With the baked goods prepped the night before, I focused the morning of the event on tidying up the apartment, setting up the café essentials, and getting acquainted with my new coffee gear. Admittedly, I\'m still a novice when it comes to pulling shots and steaming milk, but practice makes perfect, right?<br/><br/>As the clock struck noon, my first guests arrived, greeted by the delightful aroma wafting through the apartment and the inviting setup with menus on display. Orders started pouring in, from lattes to cappuccinos to matcha delights. Despite the slight learning curve, I managed to keep up with the demand, though it did keep me from joining in on the conversations—a lesson learned for next time.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I couldn\'t help but notice the relaxed atmosphere and the genuine openness of everyone sharing their stories. It\'s heartening to see how this experience brings people closer together. Plus, everyone was game to jot down their thoughts in my \'Bottled Pondering\' book - a tradition I picked up in Copenhagen, where I’d ask the people around me in social situations to a chosen prompt that sparks introspection and fosters a deeper connection.<br/><br/>As the event wound down, it was time for goodbyes and cleanup. Despite the hustle, I had a fantastic time, and I\'m eager to host the official first Brews & Bites in the new year!","guests":[{"name":"Anjuli","order":"(Hot) Cappuccino w/ 2% Milk"},{"name":"Asher","order":"(Hot) Latte w/ Oat Milk"},{"name":"Clay","order":"Hot Cocoa"},{"name":"Mags","order":"(Iced) Latte w/ Oat Milk"},{"name":"Sam","order":"Affogato"},{"name":"Steven","order":"(Hot) Latte w/ Almond Milk"},{"name":"Theo","order":"(Iced) Matcha Latte w/ Almond Milk"},{"name":"Tommy","order":"(Iced) Matcha Latte w/ Oat Milk"}],"photos":["v0-1.png","v0-2.png","v0-3.png","v0-4.png","v0-5.png","v0-6.png","v0-7.png","v0-8.png","v0-9.png","v0-10.png","v0-11.png","v0-12.png"]},{"id":1,"iteration":"v1","menuFront":"v1-front.png","menuBack":"v1-back.png","date":"January 6, 2024","title":"The Brews & Bites saga continues... Stop by and enjoy some drinks, snacks, and and a whole latte joy!","story":"Today marked the true launch of my apartment coffee pop-up, and boy, was it an adventure getting everything just right before my friends arrived.<br/><br/>First up, the baked goods. I whipped up some delicious bagels, following a recipe from my buddy Alec out in Los Angeles. They were a labor of love, requiring an overnight dough prep and a morning of boiling, seasoning, and baking. Alongside those, I decided to showcase my beloved banana bread recipe, crafting both a large loaf and a mini version for that extra visual appeal. Topped off with a bowl of mandarins, the spread was set.<br/><br/>Next, it was all about the coffee. I opted for two 12 oz bags of beans from \'Stumptown\', choosing their \'Holler Mountain\' blend for its organic goodness and caramel notes. Thankfully, dialing in the grind size and shot pull times was a breeze with these beans.<br/><br/>With the food and brews sorted, it was time to spruce up the apartment. Out came the Dyson and Swiffer, banishing any pet hair, crumbs, or dust. Chairs were arranged, windows thrown open, coasters laid out, and lights switched on. Ready or not, here we go.<br/><br/>Guests started trickling in at noon, prompting a flurry of activity as I ushered them up and juggled incoming orders. Mental note for next time: delegate someone to handle the elevator duty—I\'ve got drinks to make! This time, I had everyone fill out cute little Guest Checks with their name, order, milk preference, and toppings, which was a real lifesaver amidst the hustle.<br/><br/>As folks settled in, the compliments on the food and drinks started pouring in, and I couldn\'t help but feel a swell of pride and joy. Seeing friends from different parts of my life mingle and hit it off was pure magic—they\'re the heart and soul of who I am, and watching them connect was a real treat.<br/><br/>I won’t go into the details of any of the discussions, since this was a safe space for people to talk about whatever they want, personal or otherwise. But I will say, the dialogue flowed effortlessly, and as 3 pm crept closer, it was time to bid adieu. Hugs were exchanged, jackets slipped on, and with that, the apartment returned to its quiet state. Until next time, my friends.","guests":[{"name":"Anjuli","order":"(Hot) Latte w/ Oat Milk, Hazelnut Syrup"},{"name":"Asher","order":"(Iced) Latte w/ Oat Milk"},{"name":"Christine","order":"(Iced) Matcha Latte w/ Oat Milk"},{"name":"Clay","order":"Hot Cocoa"},{"name":"Jack","order":"(Iced) Latte w/ Oat Milk"},{"name":"Lesley","order":"(Hot) Matcha Latte w/ Almond Milk, Vanilla Syrup"},{"name":"Mags","order":"(Iced) Matcha Latte w/ Oat Milk"},{"name":"Raine","order":"(Iced) Latte w/ Oat Milk, Vanilla Syrup"},{"name":"Sam","order":"(Iced) Latte w/ Oat Milk"},{"name":"Steven","order":"Water"},{"name":"Tommy","order":"(Iced) Matcha Latte w/ 2% Milk"}],"photos":["v1-1.png","v1-2.png","v1-3.png","v1-4.png","v1-5.png","v1-6.png","v1-7.png","v1-8.png","v1-9.png","v1-10.png","v1-11.png","v1-12.png","v1-13.png","v1-14.png","v1-15.png","v1-16.png","v1-17.png","v1-18.png","v1-19.png","v1-20.png","v1-21.png"]},{"id":2,"iteration":"v2","menuFront":"v2-front.png","menuBack":"v2-back.png","date":"January 27, 2024","title":"Espresso yourself at Brews & Bites v2! Sip, chat, and munch on happiness. See you for a cup full of smiles!","story":"With a few Brews & Bites events under my belt, you\'d think I\'d have the prep down to a science by now. Well, this time, I decided to kick it up a notch and tackle croissants for the first time. What could possibly go wrong, right?<br/><br/>After diving into countless YouTube tutorials, I settled on Claire Saffitz\'s recipe. Little did I realize just how time-consuming it would be—between freezing and chilling the dough, butter block, dough w/ butter block, it was well past 3 am before everything was ready to roll, shape, and proof.<br/><br/>Come morning, it was all hands on deck. With a tight deadline looming and the event starting at noon, every minute counted. As the croissants proofed in the oven, I found myself unexpectedly tied up with a Facebook Marketplace score—a Canon Pixma Pro-100 printer at a steal. Wrestling with setup quirks ate up the entire proofing window, but I managed to iron out the kinks just in time to print menus on 100lb card stock.<br/><br/>With the croissants finally in the oven, I realized there was zero time left for banana bread. Cue a mad dash through the rain to snag mini muffins and cookies from Whole Foods to round out the spread. Back home, it was a whirlwind of plating—muffins on one plate, cookies on another, frozen grapes here, peeled mandarins there, and croissants proudly displayed on a Lazy Susan. Spread, check.<br/><br/>A lightning-fast shower and apartment tidy-up later, and boom—it was noon and guests were already arriving. This time, I smartly had someone on elevator duty, leaving me free to whip up drinks. Interestingly, drinks with espresso was the order of the day, a departure from the matcha craze of our last gathering.<br/><br/>Thanks to my growing proficiency with the coffee gear—a Baratza Sette 270 grinder and Ascaso Steel PID Duo espresso machine—I churned out drinks in record time. And for once, I actually had a chance to sit down and chat with my friends for the majority of the time - sharing laughs, stories, and even jotting down answers to a prompt on page 88 of my thought-provoking book.<br/><br/>As 3 pm approached, hugs were exchanged all around—a fitting farewell for our last Brews & Bites until March, as I\'ll be jetting off on travels throughout February. It was heartwarming to see my friends bonding even more, growing more comfortable with each other with every gathering. It\'s moments like these that make hosting these little soirées in my apartment so special, and I\'m thrilled to see everyone eagerly anticipating the next one.","guests":[{"name":"Anjuli","order":"(Hot) Cappuccino w/ Banana Milk"},{"name":"Asher","order":"(Hot) Banana Milk Latte w/ Chocolate Drizzle"},{"name":"Christine","order":"(Iced) Banana Milk Latte w/ Oat Milk"},{"name":"Clay","order":"Hot Cocoa"},{"name":"Jack","order":"(Iced) Latte w/ Oat Milk"},{"name":"Mags","order":"(Iced) Banana Milk Latte"},{"name":"Raine","order":"(Hot) Banana Milk Latte"},{"name":"Sam","order":"(Iced) Matcha Latte w/ Oat Milk, Vanilla Syrup)"},{"name":"Steven","order":"(Iced) Banana Milk Latte w/ Hazlenut Syrup"},{"name":"Theo","order":"(Iced) Latte w/ Vanilla + Hazlenut Syrup"},{"name":"Tommy","order":"(Iced) Banana Milk Latte w/ Vanilla Syrup, Caramel Drizzle"}],"photos":["v2-1.png","v2-2.png","v2-3.png","v2-4.png","v2-5.png","v2-6.png","v2-7.png","v2-8.png","v2-9.png","v2-10.png","v2-11.png","v2-12.png","v2-13.png","v2-14.png"]},{"id":3,"iteration":"v3","menuFront":"v3-front.png","menuBack":"v3-back.png","date":"March 9, 2024","title":"After a month long hiatus, brews & bites is back with a central american flair and a a mouthwatering chocolate tasting extravaganza!","story":"Chocolate Tasting Options<br/><br/>North Fields 60% Cacao<br/>North Fields 70A% Cacao<br/>North Fields 85% Cacao<br/><br/>Balfour Dark Chocolate Tropic Fruits 72% Cacao<br/>Grand Cru Chocolate Negro 70%<br/>Britt Maracuya Pasion Fruit 70% Cacao<br/>Britt Guayaba Guava 70% Cacao<br/>Lacasa Chocolate Negro Menta 70% Cacao<br/>Tutto Chocolate Semi Amargo con Mani, Pistacho, y Arros Tostado","guests":[{"name":"Friendo 1","order":"TBD"},{"name":"Friendo 2","order":"TBD"},{"name":"Friendo 3","order":"TBD"}],"photos":[]}]');
