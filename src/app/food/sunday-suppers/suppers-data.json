        "story": "Doomscrolling on TikTok as a I usually do, I swiped across this mesmerizing dish by @littlefatboyfrankie - sweet potato mochi balls, looking like gnocchi, drenched in an Asian gochujang sauce. Totally screamed Korean tteobokki vibes. Naturally, I had to share this gem with Anjuli, and bam, it became our December 3rd mission.<br/><br/>So, we gather all the goods, and jackpot - everything's in the pantry, except the sweet potato. Quick market run, and plot twist - the sweet potatoes we snagged were white, not the vibrant orange we envisioned. No biggie though, it still tasted like sweet potato, so we were in the clear.<br/><br/>Following the recipe, we boiled the spuds, mixed in the dry ingredients, and dove into the dough-making journey. But hold up—more corn starch and rice flour than expected. Did it stop us? Nah. Rolling the dough into mini balls became a marathon. Fragile dough, endless rolling, and countless stories - some juicier than the dish itself. Hours later, an army of over a hundred dough babies stood triumphant.<br/><br/>After their hot bath, these mochi balls were ready for a sauté dance with our special sauce. The sauce, though, had its quirks. Everything made sense, except the cheese part. Mozzarella stepped in for parmesan, and let me tell you, it took a detour. Instead of melting into the sauce, it turned into this delightful, candy-like chewiness.<br/><br/>As mochi balls and sauce twirled in our saucepan, it was showtime. Bowls at the ready, white sesame seeds on standby—mission complete. Popped one in my mouth, and whoa, the chewy goodness made every ounce of effort worthwhile. The texture was like a dream. And that chewy cheese? A revelation. Anjuli took a bite, the reaction? Pure astonishment. We both nodded in agreement; this mishmash of ingredients was a winner. A top contender in our Sunday Suppers ranking, no doubt.",

        "story": "We stumbled upon another culinary treasure, this time courtesy of @BasicSundayCooking on TikTok. The spotlight was on their rapid creation of sweet and sticky gochujang tofu bites, a tantalizing venture into the world of Korean cuisine. Given our shared love for all things gochujang and my current obsession with Korean flavors, this recipe was an instant contender for the latest edition of Sunday Suppers.<br/><br/>The best part? No impromptu grocery store run was required; we had all the necessary ingredients on hand. Firm, water-drained tofu, gochujang, corn syrup, ketchup, rice vinegar, minced garlic, starch, salt, and pepper were the key players. Listing them out, it seemed like quite a lineup, but hey, having them all in my kitchen just meant I was leveling up as a cook!<br/><br/>As we embarked on the cooking journey, a 30-minute catch-up session unfolded—our version of a life scrum meeting, sharing stories and updates from the past week. Once we shifted gears to the recipe, the final product graced our plates in no time. The steps were a breeze—whip up the sauce, coat the tofu cubes, and give them a delightful pan fry. Simple as that!<br/><br/>The moment of truth arrived as we plated our creation and took the first bites. CRUNCH CRUNCH, baby! The delightful combination of sweetness, savory goodness, and that satisfying crunch made every moment spent in the kitchen worthwhile. Five minutes later, and the plate was empty. This might just be our favorite recipe to date, and without a doubt, it's destined for a encore performance in the future.",

        "story": "One evening, Anjuli shared her adventure in crafting homemade pizzas with her boyfriend. As I glimpsed at the captivating pictures, a thought struck me—it bore an uncanny resemblance to something we devoured at a Seattle eatery called Skalka. Little did I know, Anjuli enlightened me on the Georgian origin of those delectable delights—Khachapuri, Georgian cheese breads. The fusion of pizza and flatbreads, coupled with the addition of milk in the dough and a tantalizing array of cheeses and a gooey egg on top, ignited our culinary curiosity. It was settled; our next Sunday Suppers would feature Khachapuri.<br/><br/>Throughout the week, we discovered a promising recipe online from Simply Homecooked, published by Dina. The beauty of it all? The only shopping required was for an assortment of cheeses; everything else already nestled in our pantry—a delightful bonus for our frugal hearts. The dough, a precursor to the main event, proved incredibly simple to whip up. After allowing it to leisurely rest for a few hours, we divided it into two portions, engaged in a bit of kneading, and got creative with shaping. I opted for a heart, while Anjuli crafted an elongated oval. A makeshift egg wash, courtesy of my trusty hands, adorned our dough, and the cheese and kale topping concoction followed suit before the oven beckoned.<br/><br/>Fifteen minutes later, we intervened, creating charming dimples in our browning breads. An encore of eggs, a sprinkle of seasonings, and an extra layer of Trader Joe's Parmesan—the final touches before the second oven rendezvous. Another brief interlude of five minutes, and there it was—the masterpiece. Instantly, we were smitten. The size, the coloring, the aesthetic appeal—it was the epitome of *servinggg*. As we tore into the bread, the cheeses gracefully unraveled and the toppings were doing their thang. Even Topher, my resident Shiba Inu, was desperate to get a quick nibble in. We knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that this Khachapuri creation had soared to the top of our Sunday Suppers list, reigning supreme for the foreseeable future.",

        "story": "So, our Sunday Supper turned into a Monday affair this time around due to scheduling conflicts, but we were determined to keep the tradition alive, even if it meant shifting it a day later. We were both feeling a bit tired decided to opt for something simpler. Anjuli mentioned earlier in the week about wanting to try making a Korean egg dish. And with a surplus of eggs in the fridge and the need to use them all before my upcoming vacation, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to give it a shot. Plus, I'm a huge fan of Korean cuisine, so I was all in!<br/><br/>We found a straightforward recipe from @yourfriendalanna, which made the process a breeze. Since we were only going to marinate the eggs for 2 hours, all we had to do was whip up the sauce, boil and peel the eggs, and let everything soak together in a container. Easy peasy. With the eggs left to marinate, we took the opportunity to catch up on the week's highlights and lowlights, and even brainstormed some ideas for our greeting cards business, Highs Lows & Rainbows. It seems like food-related events are a common thread in both our lives lately, with friends really going all out in their culinary creations. We also delved into some relationship talk, and while I'm still flying solo, it's great to see Anjuli thriving with her mans.<br/><br/>Soon enough, it was time to taste-test the eggs. We eagerly cracked open the container and each grabbed an egg. Bite after bite, we were blown away. The flavors were incredible—sweet, spicy, and oh-so-addictive. That marinade stole the show, no doubt about it. Anjuli and I were both in agreement, exchanging plenty of 'wows' between mouthfuls. After polishing off all six eggs, we decided to whip up some stir-fried green beans using the leftover sauce, and let me tell you, they were equally fantastic. We were brainstorming all the other dishes we could use this marinade for—noodles, tofu, chicken, you name it. The possibilities seemed endless.<br/><br/>As the clock neared 9:30/10 pm, exhaustion started to set in, signaling it was time to tidy up and call it a night. The next Sunday Supper would have to wait until March, once I returned from my vacation, so it was a bittersweet goodbye for now.",

I've been gallivanting around Central America for over a month, but nothing beats coming home to resume our weekly tradition with my partner-in-crime! We were craving something easy-peasy for our catch-up session (and to squeeze in a bit of Etsy shop work), so we settled on this funky twist of French onion soup by @natsnourishments. They threw in miso beans to jazz up the flavor game.<br/><br/>The ingredient list was mercifully short—onions, butter beans, garlic, miso, stock, a handful of spinach for good measure, and some seasoning. We whipped up a side of rice too, because why not? And I couldn't resist sprinkling some furikake on mine for a dash of Japanese flair. Gotta keep things interesting, right?<br/><br/>In about half an hour, everything was good to go, and we plopped down at the coffee table, ready to spill the tea and catch up on all the juicy gossip from the past month. We even sifted through my vacation photos, swapping stories and comparing notes on our favorite spots. Anjuli's been to Costa Rica before, so it was fun bouncing thoughts off each other.<br/><br/>But time flies when you're having fun, and before we knew it, it was way past bedtime. Since we shifted our Sunday Supper to a Tuesday this week (oops), we had to call it a night a bit early. Anjuli's got work in the morning, but not me—I'm livin' that funemployed life! Can't wait for next week's feast and chatter!",

        "story": "It feels like ages since our last Sunday Supper! Between our separate vacations and conflicting schedules, it's been a good two months since we've had a chance to gather around the kitchen. But finally, the stars aligned, and we were back in action, ready to whip up something delicious.<br/><br/>We scoured social media in anticipation of this long-awaited cooking session, stumbling upon an Instagram reel by @eatsbywill showcasing Aloo Pie - a fried dumpling hailing from the culinary landscape of Trinidad and Tobago. Intriguingly, it's a soft, fried pastry stuffed with boiled, spiced, and mashed potatoes, often dubbed the cousin of samosas. As a cool vegan dish to try out, it was an instant hit on our menu!<br/><br/>This time around, we had a special guest joining us—Haram! Anjuli's longtime friend was in town for work, and he graciously carved out time to hang with us. Thank goodness for his presence, especially when we found ourselves stumped by the proportions for the dough. While we tackled the spiced potato filling, Haram swiftly found a recipe online to guide us through the dough dilemma. <br/><br/>Of course, no cooking adventure would be complete without a bit of chaos. Case in point: the fire alarm debacle during our potato stuffing escapades. After a comical bout of fanning the wrong alarm and frantically airing out the kitchen, we finally managed to silence the shrieking alarm and get back on track.<br/><br/>Once all the components were prepped, we seamlessly transformed into an assembly line. Haram took charge of flattening the dough balls, I handled rolling and folding the potato mixture, and Anjuli manned the frying pan. Surprisingly, we breezed through the process with remarkable speed, churning out eight hefty Aloo Pies in no time.<br/><br/>Less than 15 minutes later, we were digging into our piping hot creations, emitting simultaneous 'YUMMM' sounds with every bite. I may or may not have devoured four of them—they were just that irresistible! With satisfied appetites, we delved into updates on our lives, particularly our dating escapades. And to cap off the evening, we dove into a game of 'We're Not Really Strangers', tackling hardcore questions and deepening our bonds well into the night.",

        "story": "Maybe we should call this Tuesday Suppers, because once again, our Sunday plans got bumped to Tuesday night. But hey, as long as we keep this tradition going, I'm all in! This week, Anjuli stumbled upon an intriguing recipe for \"Tofu Mochi\" from @fuji.cooking. These little creations promised a crispy exterior and a chewy interior, resembling pancakes in shape.<br/><br/>The recipe was delightfully simple: just silken tofu, sesame oil, cornstarch, Aomori (green seaweed powder), and chicken bouillon powder. Despite knowing the ingredients, we were still amazed by how easy it was to put together! Mixing everything took just a couple of minutes. The batter looked a bit like cottage cheese but smelled quite promising. Next up was frying them on my pancake pan. We scooped the mixture onto the pan just like pancakes, and soon enough, we had eight sizeable pieces ready to go.<br/><br/>Right off the pan, they were just as described: crispy outside and chewy inside. However, the taste was a bit underwhelming. They needed a little something extra, like a topping or drizzle, to really shine. They also didn't look very appetizing once plated, and even ended up a bit soggy instead of staying crispy. Since this wasn't enough for a full meal, we supplemented with a monkey bread sandwich thing I grabbed from Tour le Jour. Naturally, I paired it with a Coke Zero—my latest obsession.<br/><br/>With our bellies somewhat satisfied, we settled in for some much-needed catch-up time, diving into our dating lives and marveling at the similarities and differences. We also reflected on how lucky we are to enjoy life in Seattle. Until next time!",
