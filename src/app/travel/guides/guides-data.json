From there, I shuttled over to Lake Atitl찼n, crashing in quirky hostels and exploring the laid-back vibes of San Pedro and San Marcos. Kayaking and hiking in and around this lake was serene and magical. And amidst all the adventure, I found myself immersed in the local culture, making new amigos, and brushing up on my Spanish.
