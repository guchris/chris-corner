      "description": "While exploring NYC with friends, I visited TheRealReal's SOHO store for the first time. On the lower floor, a unique piece with vibrant colors, intricate patterns, and patchwork instantly grabbed my attention. Its distinctive design would undoubtedly make it a standout addition to my wardrobe. To my delight, the garment draped exactly as I had envisioned. Adding to the allure, a friend mentioned that Harry Styles had worn the same piece during his tour. Immediate purchase.",

Features: Belt loops, Cord-lock drawstring at waistband, Four-pocket styling, Zip-fly, Darts at front waistband and cuffs, Cargo pocket at outseams, Unlined | As the brainchild of Japanese design veteran Keizo Shimizu, clothing label NEEDLES connotes a highly referential yet ultimately singular vision of menswear. Operating as Tokyo’s best-kept-secret before infiltrating New York City via the Shimizu-helmed Nephethens store, the brand freely integrates style cues from both cultures in equal measure. Shimizu’s early-life affinity for Ivy-league deadstock translates into off-kilter collegiate pieces, which are injected with a welcomed sense of unfamiliarity. Given his background at Nephethens, Shimizu approaches design from a retailer’s viewpoint, assembling collections that touch on a variety of styles while maintaining an air of calcultated curation. This stylistic patchwork gives way to multi-textile constructions that defy the rigidity of retrograde American menswear, offering an unexpected warmth to NEEDLES’s cross-cultural collage.",
